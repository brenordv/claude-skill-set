# System Monitoring Scripts

## CPU Usage Monitor
```bash
#!/bin/bash
threshold=90

# Monitor CPU usage and trigger alert if threshold exceeded
cpu_usage=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d. -f1)

if [ "$cpu_usage" -gt "$threshold" ]; then
    echo "ALERT: High CPU usage detected: $cpu_usage%"
    # Add notification logic (email, slack, etc.)
fi
```

## Disk Space Monitor
```bash
#!/bin/bash
threshold=90
partition="/dev/sda1"

# Monitor disk usage and trigger alert if threshold exceeded
disk_usage=$(df -h | grep "$partition" | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d% -f1)

if [ "$disk_usage" -gt "$threshold" ]; then
    echo "ALERT: High disk usage detected: $disk_usage%"
fi
```

## System Health Check
```bash
#!/bin/bash
output_file="system_health_check.txt"

# Perform system health check and save results to a file
{
    echo "System Health Check - $(date)"
    echo "================================"
    echo ""
    echo "Uptime:"
    uptime
    echo ""
    echo "Load Average:"
    cat /proc/loadavg
    echo ""
    echo "Memory Usage:"
    free -h
    echo ""
    echo "Disk Usage:"
    df -h
    echo ""
    echo "Top Processes:"
    ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10
} > "$output_file"

echo "System health check saved to $output_file"
